### 3. Code Duplication (Priority: MEDIUM) - ✅ COMPLETE

#### ✅ COMPLETED: Recipient preference resolution refactored (December 26, 2025)

**Problem**: Two nearly identical methods in `RecipientRepository`:

- `get_onedrive_folder_for_recipient()`
- `get_organize_by_year_for_recipient()`

**Solution Implemented**:

Created generic `get_recipient_preference()` method in `RecipientRepository`:

```python
def get_recipient_preference(
    self,
    recipient: dict,
    publication: dict,
    pref_key: str,
    pub_key: str | None = None,
    default: str | bool | None = None,
) -> str | bool | None:
    """
    Generic preference resolver with recipient override support.

    Priority:
    1. Recipient's custom preference for this publication
    2. Publication's default setting
    3. Provided default value
    """
    if pub_key is None:
        pub_key = pref_key

    # Check recipient's custom preference
    for pref in recipient.get("publication_preferences", []):
        if pref.get("publication_id") == publication["publication_id"]:
            value = pref.get(pref_key)
            if value is not None:
                logger.debug(
                    f"Using recipient override for {recipient['email']}: "
                    f"{pref_key}={value}"
                )
                return value
            break

    # Fall back to publication default
    pub_value = publication.get(pub_key, default)
    logger.debug(
        f"Using publication default for {recipient['email']}: {pub_key}={pub_value}"
    )
    return pub_value
```

**Refactored Methods**:

Both methods now delegate to the generic resolver:

```python
def get_onedrive_folder_for_recipient(self, recipient: dict, publication: dict) -> str:
    folder = self.get_recipient_preference(
        recipient, publication, "custom_onedrive_folder", "default_onedrive_folder", ""
    )
    return str(folder)

def get_organize_by_year_for_recipient(self, recipient: dict, publication: dict) -> bool:
    organize = self.get_recipient_preference(
        recipient, publication, "organize_by_year", "organize_by_year", True
    )
    return bool(organize)
```

**Results**:

- ✅ Eliminated ~40 lines of duplicate code
- ✅ Single source of truth for preference resolution logic
- ✅ Easier to add new recipient preferences in the future
- ✅ All 241 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ Zero regressions introduced

### 4. Magic Numbers & Constants (Priority: LOW) - ✅ COMPLETE

#### ✅ COMPLETED: Configuration settings extracted (December 26, 2025)

**Problem**: Hardcoded configuration values throughout codebase

- `serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000` (mongodb.py)
- `timeout=30.0` (httpx_client.py)
- `warning_days = 5` (default in multiple places)

**Solution Implemented**:

Created three new settings classes in `settings.py`:

```python
class DatabaseSettings(BaseSettings):
    """MongoDB configuration settings."""
    server_selection_timeout_ms: int = 5000
    connect_timeout_ms: int = 10000
    socket_timeout_ms: int = 30000
    cursor_batch_size: int = 1000

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_prefix="MONGODB_",
        case_sensitive=False,
    )

class HttpSettings(BaseSettings):
    """HTTP client configuration settings."""
    request_timeout: float = 30.0
    max_retries: int = 3
    retry_backoff: float = 2.0

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_prefix="HTTP_",
        case_sensitive=False,
    )

class NotificationSettings(BaseSettings):
    """Notification and alerting settings."""
    cookie_warning_days: int = 5
    send_summary_emails: bool = True
    admin_notification_enabled: bool = True

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_prefix="NOTIFICATION_",
        case_sensitive=False,
    )
```

**Updated Settings Class**:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self):
        self.boersenmedien = BoersenmedienSettings()
        self.onedrive = OneDriveSettings()
        self.mail = MailSettings()
        self.tracking = TrackingSettings()
        self.mongodb = MongoDBSettings()
        self.discovery = DiscoverySettings()
        self.database = DatabaseSettings()         # NEW
        self.http = HttpSettings()                 # NEW
        self.notifications = NotificationSettings() # NEW
```

**Files Modified**:

1. **settings.py**: Added 3 new settings classes
2. **mongodb.py**: Uses `settings.database.*` for all timeout configurations
3. **httpx_client.py**: Uses `settings.http.request_timeout`
4. **onedrive/service.py**: Uses `settings.http.request_timeout` (added August 2026 — the
   client previously had no explicit timeout, so it fell back to httpx's 5s default and
   caused intermittent `ReadTimeout` failures on `me/drive/root/children` calls)
5. **cookie_checking_service.py**: Uses `settings.notifications.cookie_warning_days`
6. **.env.example**: Documented all 10 new optional environment variables

**Results**:

- ✅ All magic numbers extracted to configurable settings
- ✅ Users can tune MongoDB, HTTP, and notification behavior via environment variables
- ✅ .env.example documents all options with defaults
- ✅ All 241 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ Zero regressions introduced

**Environment Variables Added**:

```bash
# MongoDB Client Timeout Settings (Optional)
MONGODB_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
MONGODB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
MONGODB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
MONGODB_CURSOR_BATCH_SIZE=1000

# HTTP Client Settings (Optional)
HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30.0
HTTP_MAX_RETRIES=3
HTTP_RETRY_BACKOFF=2.0

# Notification Settings (Optional)
NOTIFICATION_COOKIE_WARNING_DAYS=5
NOTIFICATION_SEND_SUMMARY_EMAILS=true
NOTIFICATION_ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED=true
```

---

### 5. Error Handling Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM) - ✅ COMPLETE

#### ✅ Domain Exceptions Created (Pre-existing)

**Status**: Domain-specific exception hierarchy already exists in `src/depotbutler/exceptions.py`

**Exception Hierarchy**:

```python
class DepotButlerError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all depot-butler errors."""

class AuthenticationError(DepotButlerError):
    """Authentication failed - user action required."""

class TransientError(DepotButlerError):
    """Temporary failure - safe to retry."""

class PublicationNotFoundError(DepotButlerError):
    """Publication doesn't exist in account."""

class EditionNotFoundError(DepotButlerError):
    """No edition available for publication."""

class DownloadError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to download PDF file."""

class UploadError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to upload file to OneDrive."""

class EmailDeliveryError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to send email."""

class ConfigurationError(DepotButlerError):
    """Invalid or missing configuration."""
```

**Usage Throughout Codebase**:

Domain exceptions are properly used in critical paths:

1. **httpx_client.py**: Raises `AuthenticationError`, `TransientError`, `ConfigurationError`
2. **workflow.py**: Catches domain exceptions for appropriate error handling
3. **Test suite**: Comprehensive exception handling tests in `test_workflow_error_paths.py`

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Clear distinction between retryable vs permanent failures
- ✅ Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- ✅ Enables appropriate error handling at higher levels
- ✅ Well-documented with examples in docstrings

**Note**: This was already complete before the December 26 code quality review. No action needed.

---

```python
# src/depotbutler/exceptions.py

class DepotButlerError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all depot-butler errors."""
    pass


class AuthenticationError(DepotButlerError):
    """
    Authentication failed - user action required.

    Examples:
    - Cookie expired
    - Invalid credentials
    - OAuth refresh token invalid
    """
    pass


class TransientError(DepotButlerError):
    """
    Temporary failure - safe to retry.

    Examples:
    - Network timeout
    - Service temporarily unavailable
    - Rate limit exceeded
    """
    pass


class PublicationNotFoundError(DepotButlerError):
    """Publication doesn't exist in account."""
    pass


class EditionNotFoundError(DepotButlerError):
    """No edition available for publication."""
    pass


class DownloadError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to download PDF file."""
    pass


class UploadError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to upload file to OneDrive."""
    pass


class EmailDeliveryError(DepotButlerError):
    """Failed to send email."""
    pass


class ConfigurationError(DepotButlerError):
    """Invalid or missing configuration."""
    pass
```

**Usage example:**

```python
# In httpx_client.py:
from depotbutler.exceptions import AuthenticationError, TransientError

async def login(self) -> int:
    """Authenticate with boersenmedien.com."""
    try:
        cookie_value = await mongodb.get_auth_cookie()
        if not cookie_value:
            raise AuthenticationError(
                "No authentication cookie found. "
                "Run: uv run python scripts/update_cookie_mongodb.py"
            )

        # ... attempt login ...

        if response.status_code == 401:
            raise AuthenticationError("Cookie expired or invalid")

        if response.status_code >= 500:
            raise TransientError(f"Server error: {response.status_code}")

    except httpx.TimeoutException as e:
        raise TransientError("Login timeout") from e
    except httpx.NetworkError as e:
        raise TransientError("Network error during login") from e

# In workflow.py:
from depotbutler.exceptions import AuthenticationError, TransientError

async def run_full_workflow(self):
    try:
        await self.boersenmedien_client.login()
    except AuthenticationError as e:
        # Clear: User must update cookie
        logger.error(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
        await self.email_service.send_error_notification(
            error_msg=f"Authentication failed:<br>{e}<br><br>"
                     f"Please update your cookie.",
            title="Authentication Required"
        )
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    except TransientError as e:
        # Clear: Retry logic
        logger.warning(f"Temporary failure: {e}")
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        return await self.run_full_workflow()  # Retry
```

---

### 6. Function Complexity (Priority: MEDIUM) - ✅ COMPLETE

#### ✅ COMPLETED: Sprint 3.5 - All C-grade functions eliminated (December 23, 2025)

**Achievement**: Eliminated all functions with complexity C (11-19) or higher

**Functions Refactored** (see Sprint 3.5 section for details):

1. ✅ `NotificationService.send_consolidated_notification` - E(32) → A(3)
2. ✅ `HttpxBoersenmedienClient.get_latest_edition` - D(21) → B(6)
3. ✅ `DepotButlerWorkflow.run_full_workflow` - C(19) → A(5)
4. ✅ `HttpxBoersenmedienClient.login` - C(16) → A(3)
5. ✅ `HttpxBoersenmedienClient.discover_subscriptions` - C(16) → B(7)
6. ✅ `PublicationProcessor.process_publication` - C(11) → B(6)
7. ✅ `PublicationDiscoveryService.sync_publications_from_account` - C(12) → A(3)

**Final Results**:

- 0 functions with complexity C or higher ✅
- Highest complexity: B (9) - Two helper functions
- Average complexity: A (2.86) - Excellent
- 233 code blocks analyzed
- All 241 tests passing (100% success rate)

**Method**: Extracted helper methods using Single Responsibility Principle

---

### 7. Async Context Manager Usage (Priority: LOW)

#### Observation: Some async operations could use context managers more consistently

**Example in httpx_client.py:**

```python
# Current:
self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    cookies=cookies,
    headers=headers,
    follow_redirects=True,
    timeout=30.0
)

# Better (if client is short-lived):
async with httpx.AsyncClient(
    cookies=cookies,
    headers=headers,
    follow_redirects=True,
    timeout=30.0
) as client:
    # Use client
    pass
```

**Note**: Current implementation is fine for long-lived clients. This is a minor point.

---

### Sprint 4: Test Infrastructure Improvements - **COMPLETE** ✅

**Started**: December 23, 2025
**Completed**: December 23, 2025
**Goal**: Reduce test boilerplate and improve maintainability
**Achievement**: Reduced 33 workflow tests from 2,068 lines → 1,244 lines (824 lines saved, 40% average reduction)

**Context**: After refactoring production code (Sprint 2), tests have grown larger due to explicit service initialization. While test coverage is excellent (241 tests passing), there's repetitive setup code that makes tests brittle and harder to maintain.

#### Problems Identified

1. **Repetitive Service Setup** (33 tests affected)
   - 18 tests in `test_workflow_integration.py`
   - 4 tests in `test_workflow_multi_publication.py`
   - 11 tests in `test_workflow_error_paths.py`
   - Every workflow integration test repeats 15+ lines of service initialization
   - Pattern: `workflow.service_x = ServiceX(deps...)`
   - Changes to service constructors require updating 33+ tests

2. **Test File Size Growth**
   - `test_workflow_integration.py`: 947 lines
   - `test_workflow_multi_publication.py`: 612 lines
   - `test_workflow_error_paths.py`: 587 lines
   - Similar patterns in other test files

3. **Brittle Tests**
   - Service dependency changes break many tests
   - Mock setup duplicated across test files
   - Hard to maintain consistency

#### Infrastructure Created ✅

- [x] **Fixture Infrastructure** - `conftest.py` updated with 9 shared fixtures:
  - `mock_settings` - Pre-configured Settings mock
  - `mock_edition` - Sample Edition object
  - `mock_boersenmedien_client` - Pre-configured HttpxBoersenmedienClient mock
  - `mock_onedrive_service` - Pre-configured OneDriveService mock
  - `mock_email_service` - Pre-configured EmailService mock
  - `mock_edition_tracker` - Pre-configured EditionTrackingService mock
  - `mock_recipients` - Sample recipient data
  - `mock_publications` - Sample publication data
  - `workflow_with_services` - **Main fixture**: Pre-wired DepotButlerWorkflow with all services

#### Refactoring Pattern Example

**Before** (typical test, ~140 lines with boilerplate):

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_full_workflow_success(mock_edition, mock_settings):
    with patch("depotbutler.workflow.Settings", return_value=mock_settings):
        workflow = DepotButlerWorkflow()

        # 30+ lines of mock setup
        mock_client = AsyncMock()
        mock_client.login = AsyncMock()
        mock_client.get_latest_edition = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_edition)
        # ... 20 more lines ...

        # 15+ lines of service initialization
        workflow.boersenmedien_client = mock_client
        workflow.onedrive_service = mock_onedrive
        workflow.cookie_checker = CookieCheckingService(workflow.email_service)
        workflow.notification_service = NotificationService(...)
        workflow.publication_processor = PublicationProcessingService(...)

        # 20+ lines of MongoDB/file patching
        with patch(...), patch(...), patch(...):
            # Actual test logic (10 lines)
            result = await workflow.run_full_workflow()
            assert result["success"]
```

**After** (with fixtures, ~40 lines total):

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_full_workflow_success(
    workflow_with_services, mock_edition, mock_publications, mock_recipients
):
    workflow = workflow_with_services

    with (
        patch("depotbutler.workflow.close_mongodb_connection", new_callable=AsyncMock),
        patch("depotbutler.workflow.get_publications", new_callable=AsyncMock, return_value=mock_publications),
        patch_discovery_service(),
        patch_mongodb_operations(mock_publications, mock_recipients),
        *patch_file_operations(),
    ):
        # Test logic (10 lines)
        result = await workflow.run_full_workflow()
        assert result["success"]

        # Assertions focus on behavior
        workflow.boersenmedien_client.login.assert_called_once()
```
