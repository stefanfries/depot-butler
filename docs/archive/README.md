# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documents that served specific purposes during development but are no longer current.

## Contents

### Validation Phase (December 26-27, 2025)

**[VALIDATION_SETUP.md](VALIDATION_SETUP.md)** and **[VALIDATION_RESULTS.md](VALIDATION_RESULTS.md)**

These documents were created for pre-implementation validation of Phase 0 (Azure Blob Storage integration). They guided the setup of:

- Azure Storage Account configuration
- Authentication testing
- PDF parsing validation
- Dependency verification

**Status**: All objectives completed through Sprint 5-7 (December 2025)

## Why Archive?

These documents are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained:

1. **Phase 0 Complete**: Blob storage is fully implemented and integrated
2. **Sprints Documented**: Implementation details are captured in [MASTER_PLAN.md](../MASTER_PLAN.md)
3. **Validation Scripts May Be Outdated**: One-time setup tools in `scripts/validation/` may not reflect current architecture
